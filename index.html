            Hello!!!
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am Keegan Williams, a first-year Computer Science major with threads in sys arch and info. I am from Kingsland, Georgia, which is best described as 15 minutes north of Jacksonville. Over the last few years, I have participated in a multitude of community cleanups, including events at local schools, protected marshes, beaches, and other. My coolest find to date has been a somewhat usable TV :&rpar;
